      <h3>Motivation & Goals</h3>

      <h4>
        At the end of 2019, the emergence of COVID-19 began to spread all over the world,
        and Taiwan was no exception.
        However, after more than a year,
        the epidemic situation has not slowed down or controlled,
        so many occupations have been forced to change.
        Even after this,
        there are still many people who are engaged in jobs that cannot be transformed.
        These people are forced to sacrifice a lot in order to live,
        but their ideas are easily ignored by the general environment of this society.
        So this website hopes to express the plight of people engaged in these occupations through data analysis.
