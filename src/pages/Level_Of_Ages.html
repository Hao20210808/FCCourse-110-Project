        <h3>What are the risks for different age groups?</h3>
        
        <p>
            For now, the elderly are still the most at-risk group.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>
            Researchers at Imperial College London found a link between age and the chance of hospitalisation, 
            and older people were more likely to require intensive care once hospitalised.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>
            Among those under 50, less than 5% required hospitalization for symptomatic reasons, compared with 24% of those in the 70-79 age group.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Calculations based on cases in China and Italy show that the proportion is as high as 71% in the over-80s.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the average age of patients in intensive care is 63, according to figures compiled by a research charity.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The CDC said early data showed that 53 percent of hospitalized patients were over the age of 55, meaning half were younger.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            But in terms of the number of intensive care patients and deaths,
            the proportion of the oldest group was much higher (80% of deaths were in people over the age of 65).
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <h3>Viruses are 'not a formula'</h3>
        <p>These are averages, so there are younger people who unfortunately suffer from more severe symptoms, some of which can be fatal.</p>

        <br/>
        
        <p>
            In Italy, the mortality rate was 0.4% in the 40-49 age group and 19.7% in the 80-89 age group. 
            In the United States, the death rate for the 40-49 age group is projected to be 0.7%.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>
            Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
            said the "vast majority of deaths were among the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions," 
            but added that the virus "was not a mathematical equation."
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <p>"There will be young severe cases next," he said.</p>

        <p>
            While there is now evidence that people over 60 are at higher risk, there are also deaths among young people, including children, the WHO said.
        </p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            A Chinese study of more than 2,000 children infected with the new coronavirus found that although the clinical manifestations of children are generally less severe than those of adults, young children,
            especially infants, are vulnerable to the virus.
        </p>
        <br/>
        
        <h3>How young people are at risk</h3>
        
        <p>
            We now know that the older you are, the higher your risk of facing the coronavirus. 
            But the WHO has warned young people not to consider themselves "invincible".
