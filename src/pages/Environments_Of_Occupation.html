        <h3>Epidemiological evidence</h3>

        <p>
            In addition to personal factors, occupation-related factors and work environment remain important risk factors for infection. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Environment and the Environmental and Modelling Group released a report in February
            2021 to explore the relationship between occupations and the risk of contracting COVID-19. Important conclusions include:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Risk factors affecting transmission include:</b></li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Exposure length and frequency (time);</li>
                <li>Proximity or physical contact with an infected person (nonlinear relationship with distance);</li>
                <li>The number of people in the same space (the probability of an infected person, and the possibility of a second infection);</li>
                <li>Individual infectivity (different virus strains are also different);</li>
                <li>Virus excretion rate (there are individual differences and differences in activities);</li>
                <li>The proportion of the virus transmitted by close-range droplets, long-distance aerosol particles, and object surfaces (there are individual differences and differences in the scene);</li>
                <li>The use and effect of control methods, including ventilation and exhaust, social distancing, hygiene measures, etc.;</li>
                <li>Socioeconomic factors (affecting the ability to self-isolate, such as housing size).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>The risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has a clear interaction with socioeconomic inequalities.</li>
            <li>Occupations that require in-person work experience have a higher risk of infection than those that allow work from home.</li>
            <li>Occupations that require more people into the workplace have a higher risk of transmission.</li>
            <li>Occupations that still require work in the workplace have a higher risk of transmission.</li>
            <li>Occupations that involve prolonged physical proximity to others have a higher risk of infection.</li>
            <li>The risk of infection may be increased by workplace factors (eg, lack of ventilation or PPE, etc.) or by factors outside the workplace (eg, socioeconomic inequality, housing size, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Community Transmission Indicators</h3>

        <p>
            The workplace is also a part of the community. If community transmission is prevalent in the area where the workplace is located, occupations that require direct contact with suspected confirmed cases or confirmed cases at work, and occupations that require
            frequent or close contact with the public, colleagues, visitors, customers, contractors and other groups of people at work Occupations have a higher possibility of being exposed to confirmed cases at work, and thus being infected at work.
            Therefore, it is necessary to understand the community transmission situation in the community where workers work to assess their occupational exposure risk, and the workplace is also It is necessary to adjust its epidemic prevention strategy
            and operation mode for this purpose.

        <h3>Workplace Clusters</h3>
        <p>
            Regarding workplace clusters, according to the US-CDC definition, for non-health care industries, COVID-19 workplace clusters are defined as "more than 2 confirmed or suspected cases within 14 days, and there is a potential connection in time and place,
            such as Same workplace, employer-provided accommodation, or shared employer-provided accommodation pass tool. "
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h4>In view of the above, this guideline defines workplace clustering as follows:</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>More than 2 confirmed cases (including colleagues, visitors, clients, consumers, contractors, etc.) within 14 days.</li>
            <li>There is a reasonable epidemiological link between cases in time and place, such as the same workplace, the same shift, working in the same building, sharing employer-provided accommodation, sharing transportation, etc.</li>
        </ol>
