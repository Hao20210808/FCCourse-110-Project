Occupational Environment Epidemic Diagnosed Population Network
(Statistics on high-risk groups based on the relationship between occupation, age and the number of confirmed cases)


Motivation & Goals:
At the end of 2019, the emergence of COVID-19 began to spread all over the world, and Taiwan was no exception. However, after more than a year, the epidemic situation has not slowed down or controlled, so many occupations have been forced to change. Even after this, there are still many people who are engaged in jobs that cannot be transformed. These people are forced to sacrifice a lot in order to live, but their ideas are easily ignored by the general environment of this society. So this website hopes to express the plight of people engaged in these occupations through data analysis.


Data Print:
We will display various occupations and their age groups in a graph (graphics) for comparison. In this era of outbreaks, is it true that the probability of diagnosis of the elderly population is much higher than that of other ethnic groups? In addition, we will also consider several doses of vaccines and severe Kansina.


Data Resourse:
The main purpose of giving this kind of information is to let everyone know more about the new coronavirus COVID-19 and provide assistance, and I hope you can know what to do when faced with this kind of global disease to ensure your own health.
